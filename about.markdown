Hello! My name is Laura, I'm a 3rd year doctorate student at University of Cambridge, currently part of the [Experimental and Comparative Connectomics group](https://syn.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/index.html) at [MRC LMB](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/about-lmb/). 

My PhD work is focused on multisensory integration (i.e. how the brain processes processes streams of sensory information). While I embrace a reductionist approach to understanding the brain, I'm also  interested in cognitive neuroscience, psychology and philosphy, particularly subjects such as free will, meta-cognition and epistemology.





Outside of that I'm working on a couple of projects: 
1. I'm trying to create an [Instutue for Ethical AI](https://lauralungu.com/blog/ethicalAIinstitute/) research and pursuing this as part of this year's [Polaris](https://www.polaris-fellowship.com/) cohort, a fellowship organised by Entrepreneur First. 

2. I'm working on integrating Neuroscientific knowledge into the Criminal Justice system, to promote rehabilitation over punishment. To this end, I'm currently trying to implement a sabbatical for neuroscientists in the judicial system with [UK DAY 1](https://ukdayone.org/).
