Hello! My name is Laura, I'm a 3rd year Neuroscience PhD at University of Cambridge, currently part of the [Experimental and Comparative Connectomics lab](https://syn.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/index.html). 

My PhD is focused on the link between neural structure and function, especially in the context of multisensory integration (i.e. how the brain processes streams of sensory information). 

Outside of that I'm working a couple of projects: 
1. I'm trying to create an [Instutue for Ethical AI](https://lauralungu.com/blog/ethicalAIinstitute/) research, and hoping to pursue this as part of this year's [Polaris](https://www.polaris-fellowship.com/) cohort, a fellowship organised by Entrepreneur First. 

2. I'm working on integrating Neuroscientific knwoedge into the Criminal Justice system, to promote rehabulitation over punishment. 


 projects pertaining to AI Safety, Criminal Justice and Enrepreneurship. 
While I embrace a reductionist approach to understanding the brain, I'm also  interested in behavioural neuroscience and philosophy, particularly when it comes to free will and consciousness. I like writing about these topics not only to train my abilities of self expression, but also to invoke insightful conversation about these complex subjects.
