Hi! I'm a 1st year doctorate student at University of Cambridge in Neuroscience, currently part of the [Experimental and Comparative Connectomics lab](https://syn.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/index.html). I'm interested in the link between neural structure and function, especially in the context of multisensory integration (i.e. how the brain processes streams of sensory information). While I embrace a reductionist approach to understanding the brain, I'm also  interested in behavioural neuroscience and philosophy, particularly when it comes to free will and consciousness. I like writing about these topics not only to train my abilities of self expression, but also to invoke insightful conversation about these complex subjects. 

Get in touch!
