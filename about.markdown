Hello! My name is Laura, I'm a PhD candidate at University of Cambridge, currently part of Albert Cadona's [Experimental and Comparative Connectomics group](https://syn.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/index.html) at [MRC LMB](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/about-lmb/). 

My doctoral research is focused on multisensory integration (i.e. how the brain processes and integrates streams of sensory information). While I embrace a reductionist approach to understanding the brain, my interests span cognitive neuroscience, psychology and philosophy. On the side, I'm passionate about justice. Individuals who have significantly shaped my thoughts on these topics include David Deutsch, Robert Sapolsky and Michael Sandel. My scientific conduct and intellectual rigour are mostly inspired by my first mentor [Devin Terhune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Terhune).

I am actively engaged in bridging the gap bewteen [Science and the Gorvenment](https://ukdayone.org/briefings/bringing-science-tech-talent-to-government) with the ultimate goal of applying insights from neuroscience to the Criminal Justice system, aiming to prioritize rehabilitation over punishment.
