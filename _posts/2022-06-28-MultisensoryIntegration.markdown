when someone is speaking to you, does the movement of their lips appear synchronus to the sound coming out of their mouth? Likely the answer is yes. I use appear intentionally, as these aren’t actually timed, sound always comes later. Our brains just does this to make sure that, by the time these senses reach awareness, you percieve them concurrently. I’ll try and explain how that happens in this post.
