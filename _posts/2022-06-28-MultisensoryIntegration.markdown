Let me ask you this, when someone speaks to you, does the movement of their lips appear synchronous to the sound coming out of their mouth? I use appear intentionally, as these aren’t actually timed, sound always comes later; but by the time these senses reach awareness, we percieve them concurrently.

The brain does it all the time: it takes streams of sensory information and outputs only one coherent representation - the one most favourable for survival.  The processing of sensory evidence is coupled with our expectations of what the world should look like(priors) giving rise to perception and cognition. You could say that, in a way, our perception of the world is illusory, in the sense that it’s not an accurate representation of reality, but rather an interpretation optimal to survival.

**How does it happen?**

We tend to think of senses in isolation but  in reality, as soon as they pass the receptive layer, they’re integrated and turned into actions. This is known as *multisensory integration*, and has 2 main purposes:

- to increases sensitivity (e.g.  hearing, seeing and smelling the threat is more efficient than just hearing it)
- to decrease ambiguity (when one sense compensates for another - e.g. it might be dark outside and I might not see the threat, but for sure I’m aware of it from the baffling noise it makes in the middle of the night)
