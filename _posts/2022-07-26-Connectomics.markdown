Whether or not you heard about the term, you definitely heard about the scientific conundrum behind **connectomics**: how do networks of *billions* of neurons and *trillions* of connections in our nervous system produce actions, thoughts, emotions and memories? Well, connectomics aims to answer just that! By means of advanced neuroimaging techniques including, most notably, electron microscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we hope to map connectomes of human and non-human animals, and unravel the structural basis of behaviour.

What is a **connectome**, you ask? Put simply, a *connectome* is the complete set (*ome*) of neural connections in a central nervous system. The addition of the suffix *omics* simply indicates the study of an *ome*, so that's connectomics, the in-depth study of biological systems' connectomes. Now that we got etymology & definition out of the way, let's answer the big questions: **how do we even build a connectome**; **what does it tell us** and **why is all that useful**?

The first step in building a connectome is finding an organism worthwhile exploring. The human brain is the obvious choice here, however, I’ll explain shortly why this isn’t the most popular one. Notable examples of non-human animal models include the fruit fly Drosophila, the roundworm C. elegans and the mouse. Once you pick a model of choice, the next step is to map its central nervous system (CNS). This can be done in one of two ways:

1. Via Electron Microscopy (EM), where tissue is sliced into very thin sections (~4nm) and scanned via an electron beam that can reach resolutions of up to 10nm, allowing us to distinguish **morphology, organelles** and even **individual synapses.** Using this data, we can reconstruct the complete set of neural connections within a CNS into a comprehensive 3D map (such as the one in the image above), that packs valuable anatomical and connectivity-related information. This is especially useful when inferring the role of restricted neural pathways in specific behaviours.

2. The second option is via Functional magnetic resonance imaging (or fMRI), which measures brain activity according to changes in blood flow, such that increased blood flow in one region indicates increased activity in the area of interest.

EM data tends to be preferred for its high resolution, but acquiring an EM volume and turning it into a comprehensive 3D map is no mundane task. I’ll describe this technique in detail in a later post, but for the time being, all you need to know is this: it takes the best electron microscope ***today*** **approximately** **1 year to image 1 cubic millimetre**. This is roughly the size of a pygmy squid brain (below is an image of both for reference).
